        <h2 style="color: #E95B0B;">General Policy</h2>
        <p>The policy of our company is pretty simple: just follow the rules! We are convinced that focusing on quality, 
            protecting the environment, striving for safety and awareness of the risks that arise for our customers, 
            and at the same time for our company and employees, is an important factor for success in the global competition.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the quality of our products and services, as well as attention to environmental and safety issues, 
            are the highest priority for our company and an integral part of our corporate philosophy. At our core, 
            we want to improve the services of our customers. To achieve this goal, which is part of our message and perspective, 
            we have guided the system on 5 core principles:</p>

                        which we achieve not only by high quality and provided services, but also by efficiently managed support processes.
                        Timeliness, helpfulness and adaptability are integral parts of our entrepreneurial philosophy.
